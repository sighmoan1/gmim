  <b>Notice from GMIM Advanced Technology Department</b></h1>
  <p class="devnotes">
  This is a prototype of a digital GMIMCoin management system that lets users:
  </p>
  <li class ="devnotes" margin-left=-15>See a list of users and their GMIMCoin balances
  <li class ="devnotes">Register an account
  <li class ="devnotes">Login
  <p class="devnotes">What you can do when logged in depends on your role:</p>
  <li class ="devnotes">Loyal Supporters can see how many GMIMcoin they have.
  <li class ="devnotes">Representatives can generate GMIMCoin.
  <li class ="devnotes">CEO can allocate roles to different users and edit GMIMCoin balances.
  <h3 class="devnotes">Generating GMIMCoin</h3>
  <p class="devnotes">When you generate GMIMCoin you get a link for GMIMCoin that can be allocated once to a user.<br>The person who gets the link can go to the link, login and claim the GMIM coin<p>
  <h3 class="devnotes">To Do List</h3>
  <p class="devnotes">Now we have this basic functionality we can work in some more changes.</p>
  <li class ="devnotes">Add passwords and password management to user accounts
  <li class ="devnotes">Let users login to their accounts with google, facebook, instagram etc.
  <li class ="devnotes">Add content for people to view on the site
  <li class ="devnotes">Change what content people see when they are logged in based on the amount of GMIMCoin they have.
  <li class ="devnotes">Deal with technical debt - add a real database etc.
  <li class ="devnotes">Make the website a progressive web app so it can be downloaded from the browser
  <li class ="devnotes">Make iOS and Android apps people can get from app stores
  <li class ="devnotes">Any more?
